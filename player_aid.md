# Player Aid - Game Rules and Mechanics

## Turn Structure

On your turn, choose one of the two main actions: **Expand** or **Consolidate**.


## Hand Management Rules

### Starting Conditions
- **Player starts with 5 cards in hand**
- **Card Playing Limit**: Player can play **1 card from hand per turn** unless a power gives them a second card play

### Card Playing Mechanics
- **Single Card Play**: Normally, you can only play one card per turn

At the end of your turn:

2. Check if the end of the game is triggered

### Game End Conditions
- A player scores **15 Victory Points (VPs)**
- The **Common deck is empty**

When either condition is met:
- **Finish the current round** so that every player has the same number of turns
- Calculate final scores and determine the winner

## Guild System and Card Playing Rules

### Guild Structure
- **Cards are separated into 5 guilds**
- **Each guild has cards of 5 different colors**
- **Card playing restrictions**:
  - When playing a card, you can play it on top of a pile of the same guild (or on the table if it's the first card of this guild)
  - You **cannot** play a card if the same color of that guild has been played previously
  - **Example**: If there's a military guild pile with red and blue cards already played, you cannot play another red or blue military card, but you can play a green military card

### Card Power Scaling
- **Card powers increase** depending on how many cards of that guild are in the pile:
  - **1st card**: Basic actions (e.g., Army. Pay 1 Gold → Army)
  - **2nd/3rd card**: Enhanced actions (e.g., Army. Army)
  - **4th/5th card**: Advanced actions (e.g., Army. Army. Discard a card for 1 Victory Point)

### Dominion Expansion
- **At game start**: Each player can only play cards in **3 different piles** (3 guilds)
- **As game progresses**: When you expand your dominion, you can play **4 or 5 guilds** in front of you

  - You **do not** have to discard a card to do so
  - Return the Assassin to its owner (they can put it on their knowledge track)
  - *Note: You cannot take Free actions during Consolidation, so you cannot Pay 1G to move an Assassin before dismantling*

  - Move the Assassin to the next card in that pillar (column)
  - If the exiled card was the only card in the column, return the Assassin to its owner

- When you get an **Army effect**, you can move a Guard to an adjacent card in your Dominion instead of placing an army on the map
- This **does not trigger** the Bonus effect on the card your Guard moved to
